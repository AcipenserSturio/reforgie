adj = "Tovkhanan Z'ee"
pedia = """The Nakh or Vainkah religion is remarkably complex. Representations of deities were placed in sanctuaries and temples and forms of idolatry were practices. Deela or Dal is regarded as the supreme being, presiding over a motley crew of gods and demigods, each controlling one aspect of the universe. He commands complete obedience and is markedly harsh on misdeeds, for instance gouging the eyes of his own son, Elta, for his mistakes. The name 'tovkhanan z'ee' refers to the axis mundi or world-chain which connects heaven, earth and the underworld."""
