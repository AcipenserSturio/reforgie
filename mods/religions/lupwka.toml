pedia = """The religion of the Kalash and Nuristanis in the mountains of northern Afghanistan and Kashmir is a relic of ancient Indo-European and Indo-Iranian mythologies, distinct from Hinduism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism and other major Indo-Iranian and Indo-European religions. It has been estimated to have become established in the mountains around the time of Alexander the Great; beforehand, it was a slight variant of a wider subtrate of Indo-Iranian language across Central Asia. Its major deities are close to Hinduism - for example, the supreme being is Imro, similar to an old name for Yama, the Hindu and Buddhist deity of death and the afterlife. 'God-callers' or shamans are known as L’upw-kâ in the Nuristani dialect, although nearly all have died as a result of modernisation and conversion to Islam from the 19th to the 21st century."""
