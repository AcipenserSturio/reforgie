pedia = """Haldi was one of the three chief deities of Urartu. He was a warrior god to whom the kings of Urartu would pray for victories in battle. á¸ªaldi was portrayed as a man with or without wings, standing on a lion. His principle shrine was at Ardini (Musasir). The temples dedicated to Khaldi were adorned with weapons such as swords, spears, bows and arrows, and shields hung from the walls and were sometimes known as "the house of weapons". He was the primary god of the most prominent group of Urartian tribes, which eventually evolved into the Armenian nation. Some sources claim that the legendary patriarch and founder of the Armenians, Hayk, is derived from Haldi, but other theories about the etymology of Hayk are more widely accepted."""
