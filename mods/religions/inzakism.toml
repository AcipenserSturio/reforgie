pedia = """Inzak was a god worshipped by the people of Dilmun. The ancient Sumerians regarded him as the chief god of the Dilmunite pantheon, but the Dilmunites themselves regarded him as a god of Agaru, a land in eastern Arabia.[1] His main cult center was on Failaka Island, where a temple was dedicated to him. During the Neo-Babylonian Period, Inzak was identified with Nabu. According to Khaled al-Nashef (1986), Inzak was the deity of date-palms. He was also worshiped in Susa. It is difficult to determine whether the cult spread from Dilmun to Susa or vice versa, but either way this probably happened in prehistoric times, without Mesopotamian influence. Inzak's divine spouse was the goddess Meskilak. Together they were worshiped as the main deities of Dilmun. Both names lack plausible Sumerian etymologies and are likely native; Sumerians equated the two with Enki and Ninhursag."""
