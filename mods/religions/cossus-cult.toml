pedia = """Coso, Cossus or Coseu was the god of war of the ancient Asturians, Cantabrians and Gallaeci. As their socieites transitioned from peaceful trade to nearly permanent warfare with the arrival of the Carthaginians and Romans, the cult of Coso, in military gatherings and 'brotherhood assemblies' became the dominant force among peoples in the region. While it might have been derived from the Roman Mars and the Greek Ares, Coso became a very specific patron deity to mountaineer warriors and highly armed mountain farmsteads."""
