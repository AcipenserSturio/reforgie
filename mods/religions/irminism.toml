pedia = """Irminism is a hypothesised branch of Germanic paganism that centered around the worship of the Irminsul, the Saxon equivalent of the Norse Yydraggsil. Some evidence points to the existence of a god called Irmin or Hermion, which translated in old Saxon to 'strong' or 'mighty'. This god was probably also related to the Norse Thor or Odin, especially since Odin was assigned as the protector of the World Tree. Saxons, Suebians and smaller Germanic groups such as the Chatii and Warini followed some kind of Irmin-worship, to the extent that the Romans lumped them together as 'Irminones', while the Jutes and Angles were classed as Ingvaeones, i.e. followers of Yngvi-Freya, the Norse deity, and the Franks in the south-west were known as Istvaeones, after another legendary figure called Istio or Hessito. Unfortunately, Irminism is largely still tarnished by National Socialist and nationalist attempts to uphold it as evidence of the purity of the German race, particularly among the higher echelons of the S.S. Indeed, the term 'Irminism' originated from occult Ariosophical circles, which espoused anti-semitic and German-supremacist ideas that would become the foundation of Hitler's regime."""
