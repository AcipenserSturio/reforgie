# Sao Mythology
name = "Imana"
adj = "Imana"
pedia = """Imana is the creator god of the ancient Banyarwanda and Barundi people, in today's Rwanda and Burundi. In their mythology, Imana was the creator and the supporter of all the Barundi and Banyarwanda people. Imana was seen as almighty and gracious, intervening in one of the legends in an altercation between a man who had always borrowed beans from different people but wriggled out of repaying the debt. Some mythographers and historians propose that Imana is related, if distantly, to the Egyptian god Amun, via the migration of the Sao people, who were a Middle-Eastern people, possibly related to the Hyksos, from Egypt to the Lake Chad basin, who then filtered their beliefs across the Congo basin and into local Bantu and West African cultures. Imana and Amun share similar traits; both are creator deities and the supreme being, both are seen as immaterial and transcendental, and both intervene in cases of injustice."""
