# Tocharian Mythology

pedia = """Most of the Tocharian inscriptions are based on Buddhist monastical texts, which suggests that the Tocharians largely embraced this particular religion. The pre-Buddhist beliefs of the Tocharians are largely unknown, however there are a few tantalising fragments. For example, the Tocharian B noun swāñco, meaning ray, beam, or celestial light, is derived from the Indo-European word sóhawl, which represents the Goddess of the Sun or the sun itself. It is likely that the ancient Tocharians, and their classical descendants in Kroraina and Kucha, shared folk tales, beliefs and stories descended from common Indo-European motifs and similar to Hittite, Hurrian and Germanic beliefs. Early Chinese and Turkic influence would have shaped their beliefs considerably. The Turkic Sun Goddess, Gün Ana, has been suggestedas central to any pantheon they might have had, and there is linguistic evidence to suggest that an lunar and earth deity might have been subordinate to them."""
