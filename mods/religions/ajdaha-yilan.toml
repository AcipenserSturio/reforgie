pedia = """Despite the fact that Islam became the basic religion of the Tatars, Sibirs and Chuvash in Siberia, traditional religious beliefs have been perserved, including a belief in spirits (the so-called masters of localities), in the kukol (family guardians), and in cults of sacred trees, the earth, fire, the sun, and of various animals and birds. One of the most well known pieces of folk mythology is the Kazan Dragon, or Zilant, part of a family of Ajdaha Yilan (dragon-snakes). The Chuvash and Mari (ethnic groups living in the area of Kazan alongside the Tatars) also have legends relating to the foundation of Kazan, but none of them refer to the Kazan dragon. After the 16th century, Russians acquired the foundation legend from Tatars. For Kazan Russians, Zilant had negative connotations, as it was represented as a Slavic dragon rather than as a snake. According to one legend, when Bulgars came to found the town of Bilär, they discovered a big snake. They decided to kill it, but the snake begged for peace and pleaded with Allah to give her wings. Once she had her wings the snake flew away from Bilär. Most of these myths are remnants of a melting pot of pre-Islamic Turkic, Finnic and Slavic mythology in 7-9th century Volga Bulgaria, especially regarding lakes, dragons and ghostly spirits."""
